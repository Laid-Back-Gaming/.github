# [Laid Back Gaming](https://lbgaming.co)
## Who Are We?
We are a gaming community that hosts modded game servers in many games such as Counter-Strike, Rust, Garry's Mod, and Team fortress 2. We are a more laid-back gaming community and serve more loosened rules compared to a majority of other gaming communities. Obvously hate speech and such isnt allowed. 

We support [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/) and love working with modders/content creators to host content on our game servers to the community!

## Our Infrastructure
We are currently running using Nasulex Networks's ASN and ip space ( ASN 142632, https://nasulex.net, owned by [@Synkstar](https://github.com/Synkstar) ) which is behind Path.net for ddos mitigation. LBG currently runs on a 12900ks tempest dedi w/ 64gb of ddr5 in Chicago US for North America and a 12900k hetzner dedi in Frankfurt Germany w/ 128gb ddr4 for the European Union.
We also have a cheap OVH machine to run web applications but I may replace it in the future.

## Past infrastructure. 
We used to run our own anycast with a custom made xdp program on ~30 vps's but we got rid of it to replace it with path since this was very costly and had issues. Path is better since it also has proper ddos mitigation and is a large scale network designed for anycast. To do a setup like this ourselves with good ddos mitigation would be even more costly.
